Hello, I'm Will from the Wholesale IT, GTRF department, and from Xi'an. It's a great honor to be able to join in this exchange event. In the past period, I have been participated in Crafting Engineer Programmer, mainly focusing on the GAI direction. I developed a VS Code plugin similar GitHub Copilot and learned to use Lang Chain for AI-related application development. Normally, I work in Trade Transaction team, which is also a remarkable project that we have been working on for over five years. I hope to learn more about the latest technological trends in companies in Guangzhou this time and be able to participate in them again.


我记得有一次Wendy 去西安的时候给我们介绍了你去微软的了解他们在Open AI方面的情况，时间很快，现在我们团队也在推广使用GitHub Copilot,  我也能够参与到相关的项目，所以我的问题是，我们是否会在公司内部建立一个自己AI 平台，像AI代理市场这样，提供各种各样的小工具，甚至不只是面向开发人员的，而是全体员工的。
